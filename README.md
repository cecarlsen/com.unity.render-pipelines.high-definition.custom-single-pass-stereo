# High Definition Render Pipeline (Custom) - Single Pass Stereo Mod

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

This is a workaround/hack for setting custom single-pass stereo view-projection (off-axis) matrices in HDRP. The approach is to use MockHMD to enable single-pass stereo, and then overwrite the view data it provides.

The proper way to do this is by writing and compiling your own OpenXR provider ([NOT](https://discussions.unity.com/t/using-unity-xr-sdk-to-build-my-own-ar-plug-in/904304/13) a XR Provider plugin as has been previosly stated).

Based on HDRP 17.1.0 (April 2025).

## How to avoid writing a plugin

- Install *High Definition Render Pipeline* using the package manager. This will automatically install *Scriptable Render Pipeline Core*.
- Close the Unity project and move *com.unity.render-pipelines.core* from /Library/PackageCache to /Packages (removing the @hashcode). Then open the project again.
- Make these edits to *Scriptable Render Pipeline Core*:
	- In /Runtime/XR/XRView.css make the class and the constructor public.
	- In /Runtime/XR/XRPass.css make the AssignView() method public.
- Install OffAxisCamera ([Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/camera/offaxiscamera-98991)).
- Install *XR Plugin Management* using the package manager or in the Project Settings->XR window.
- Go to Project Settings->XR and install Mock HMD Loader. Then enable Initialize XR on Startup and choose SinglePass Instanced under MockHMD.
- Go to Project Settings->Quality->HDRP->XR and disable Occlusion Mesh.
- Close the Unity project and drop this repo at some path. Then edit your package manifest.json file to point to that path. For example: *"com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition": "file:../../PackageRepos/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition.custom-single-pass-stereo",*
- Cross your fingers and re-open your project.
- In your scene:
	- Add a OffAxisCamera component to your main camera and give it a reference to a "Window Transform".
	- Add SinglePassStereoSetup to an object and set a per eye resolution.


## What was modded in HDRP?

- Runtime/RenderPipeline/Camera/HDCamera.cs was modified, see line 600.
- Runtime/SinglePassStereoSetup.cs was added.


## Known issues

- Setting a target RenderTexture on your camera will disable stereo rendering. I have no idea why. The target texture obviously has to mimic the default output texture, so Dimension 2DArray with two slices, Color Format B10G11B11_UFLOAT_PACK32, and Depth Stencil Format D32_SFLOAT_S8_UINT. But if you assign such (or any) texture as target and check the Frame Profiler, you will see that the XR plugin events from MockHMD are gone. My best guess is that MockHMD checks if a target texture is set on the camera, and if so presumes we don't want stereo. The MockHMD C# does not mention a target texture anywhere, so it must happen in the DLL. Just great =(


## Notes

First I tried to access XRPass.AssignView() and XRView using reflection, but I couldn't find a way to not generate a ton of garbage â€“ hence the SRP Core edits.

[Here](https://discussions.unity.com/t/custom-single-pass-stereo-matrices-in-hdrp-how) is the Unity Discussions thread that lead to the soltuion.
